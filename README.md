1.Quickly suggested the shortest path to an ambulance to reach one or more patientâ€™s place sooner to save a life.

2.Improved the execution time from 37 seconds to 3 milliseconds to process a dense graph having 105 nodes and 106 edges.

3.Improved the execution time from 58 seconds to 6 seconds to visit 13 patients at once which may leed to save a life.

4.Implemented Bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm and Genetic algorithm to improve the execution times(stated above).

5.Published a Research paper - [Click Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397200/authors#authors)
